RIVALS: Running Intervals
=========================

To compile:

You will need to have CMake installed: http://www.cmake.org/  
Download instructions for CMake are available at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Type "cmake ." in this directory (assuming cmake is installed), and then run "make"

To run:
Go to the Exec directory and type

./rivals scripts/test.lua

You should get the following output:
